									<h2 class="major">My Academic Journey</h2>
									<p> Since my younger years, I have had a deep fascination for the world of Science and Technology, and this ardor has served as a driving force in my academic pursuits. Through persistent dedication, I was fortunate enough to receive the distinguished NTSE scholarship during my high school years, and later achieved a decent performance in the JEE Advanced examination. The convergence of Computer Science and Biotechnology has always intrigued me, and I have been keenly pursuing courses in Bioinformatics to augment my knowledge in this area. In recognition of the challenges that lie ahead in my entrepreneurial journey, I am seeking to broaden my horizons by undertaking a Minor degree in Business Management at the Department of Management Studies, IIT Delhi, with the aim of applying the valuable insights gained from this experience towards overcoming obstacles and realizing my goals. </p>

								<h2 class="major">My Entrepreneurial Journey</h2>
								<p> From a young age, I have possessed an innate passion for tinkering with innovative products and transforming them into thriving businesses. It wasn't until I was bestowed with the opportunity to partake in the startup ecosystem that I was able to truly unleash my potential. As a pivotal member of the core team behind<ahref="https:www.rjwada.com"> Rjwada</a>, an Augmented Reality based fashion tech startup, I honed my skills in marketing and product development while spearheading a team of skilled developers and designers in the creation of the merchant app. In addition, I actively participated in senior management and fundraising efforts, affording me a wealth of experience that has kindled within me the desire to embark on my own entrepreneurial journey. My current endeavors entail exploring the realm of Manufacturing and B2B Commerce SaaS in stealth mode as I continue to broaden my knowledge and skillset. </p>>

									<h2 class="major">My Second Love</h2>
									<p> As an ardent follower of the arts, I firmly believe that creativity is a vital facet of the human experience. I am previliged to be a part of Institute's official drama society, <ahref="https://instagram.com/ankahi_iitd">'Ankahi'</a>. My foray into the realm of short films and plays has been nothing short of a rewarding journey, and I am proud to have been part of the winning team that crafted the IITD Rendezvous 2023 short film<ahref="https://youtu.be/UUS8M2Xw_Yo"> 'Handshake'</a>. Beyond the confines of stage and screen, I find solace in amateur photography and shamelessly dump my camera roll on my<ahref="https://instagram.com/skcy.jpg">instagram</a> handle. </p>
